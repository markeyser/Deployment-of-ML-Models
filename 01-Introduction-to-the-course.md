# Introduction to the course

In this course you will learn how to take your machine learning models from the research stage to a **fully integrated API** that can be caught live and utilized on life data to make predictions.

No machine learning model brings true value until it is fully integrated and can be used to score real data. So model deployment is the most important and yet most difficult part of any typical **machine learning pipeline**.

By the end of this course you will know all the necessary steps and things you need to consider to deploy a machine learning model.

## Machine Learning Model Deployment

#### What is model deployment? 

Model deployment is the process of integrating a machine learning model into an existing **production environment** so that we can use it to make business decisions based on live or future data. It is one of the latest stages in the machine learning pipeline and potentially the most challenging.

#### Why is model deployment so important?

For a business to be able to leverage the power of a machine learning model the model needs to be fully deployed into production. If we cannot get practical insight from the model; that is, if we cannot score like data or real data with it, then the impact of the model is severely limited.

Model deployment is one of the most difficult processes in the machine learning pipeline and also the one that will allow us to extract real value from our model. 

Mother deployment requires coordination between data scientists, I.T. teams and DevOps, software developers and business professionals to make sure the model works reliably in their organization's production environment. 

This represents a major challenge because there is often a discrepancy between the programming language in which the machine learning model is written and the languages your production system can understand, and recoding the model can extend the project timeline by weeks or months. 

In order to get the most value out of the machine learning models, It is important to deploy them into production as seamlessly as possible so the business can start using them to make practical decisions.

## Why take this course?

So why should you take this course in this course? 

- In this course we are going to take you through the entire machine learning lifecycle.
- We will start with building a machine learning model utilizing Jupyter and notebooks which is what most Data Scientists are used to.
- Then you will learn how to transform that code into code that can be used in production. So first we will show you the best practices around writing production code.
- And then you will learn how to create an API and make calls to the API.
- Then we'll introduce you to testing to corroborate that research and production models produced the same outcome given the same data. You learn about continuous integration. 
- And finally we will cover various deployment solutions available to you such as platform as a service or infrastructure as a service.
- You will also learn about how to use Docker to ensure model reproducibility and robustness.

## Who is this course for?

Deployment of machine learning mothers requires a concerted effort among:

- Data Scientists 
- Software Developers 
- Data Engineers and 
- Business Domain Experts

This course offers something new and useful for all of these professionals. 

- The course is ideally suited for intermediate and advanced data scientists.
- If you have already built a few Machine Learning model and you are familiar with the different steps required to build the model like feature engineering, feature selection and you would like guidance deploying mothers to production, then this is the course for you.
- The course is also suitable for data engineers wanting to integrate model production and API into their existing data pipelines.  
- This course is also suitable for software developers that want to expand their skills to step into AI development.  
- And finally as we use mostly open source tools, this course is also suitable for open source lovers.

## So what will you take home from this course?

- In this course you will get more than eight hours of video content and lifetime access to the lectures. 

- You will take ready to use code and deploy your machine learning models using this code

- The code will be suitable to create and expand your models in production with tests and error handling.

- Also you'll be provided with code to build the APIs and make calls to them with life data.

- You will learn how to containerized your applications using Docker 

- And we will guide you through deploying your machine learning systems onto both platform as a service and infrastructure as a service Cloud computing solutions.

Finally we also include links and references to what other companies are doing worldwide to smooth and streamline their machine learning pipelines.
