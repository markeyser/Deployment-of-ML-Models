# How to Approach this course

Welcome to the lecture on how to approach this course. In this article, we suggest some guidelines on how to approach this course, depending on your background.

We have designed the course to build incrementally from a jupyter notebook to a fully integrated API, supported by production code of the machine learning model with proper logging, versioning and testing. Section after section, we will transform the code incrementally, so you can follow on and understand the newly added pieces of code, and how we progressively restructure the code in different scripts and folders. If you are not familiar with writing production code, it is essential that you follow the course in the suggested order, and make sure you visit the code scripts ahead of the video lectures.  

#### Data Scientists

If you are familiar with building machine learning models, but haven't yet deployed a model, we recommend that you follow the sections in the suggested order. Pay particular attention to section 5, where we will refresh the knowledge of essential tools like git, and virtual environments. From section 6 onward, make sure you first checkout the git commit number / section that we point you to and read and familiarise with the code first, ahead of jumping on to the lecture. Then watch the videos, where we will explain more about what the key and new pieces of code are. The key knowledge is in the code scripts, so make sure you fully understand what is going on in the scripts.  

#### Software Engineers

If you are familiar with software engineering best practices, and are an avid developer, then you can skip the video lectures in sections 4 to 7. You probably don't need to go over the code incrementally within each section. You may as well feel comfortable with going over the code in the last commit for each section only. Make sure however that you understand well sections 2 and 3, and understand well how to write code using the scikit-learn pipeline and the code base in the scikit-learn API to write your transformers (included in section 4).
