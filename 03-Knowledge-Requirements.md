# Knowledge Requirements

In this video you can learn the knowledge you should have to make the most out of this course the courses.

## Machine Learning

- Feature Engineering
- Feature selection
- Linear and Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Trees
- Gradient Boosted Trees (xgb)
- Model Diagnostics: ROC-AUC, mse

The course is tailored to students with some knowledge of data science.

You should be familiar with the meaning of feature engineering and feature selection and why it is important and you should also know at least the most commonly used machine learning algorithms like linear and logistic regression and Random Forests. You should also know how to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm. 

In the course we will deploy a linear regression model and in the last section we will deploy a convolution of neural network.

It will be helpful for you to understand what a linear regression is although you don't necessarily need to be familiar with deep learning to follow on with Section 13.

In Section 2, we give you a quite extensive overview on the different steps of the machine learning pipeline including what feature engineering is and what feature selection is and why they are important.

However it is not within the scope of the course to teach you the different ways in which you can engineer and select your features.

It is also not within the scope of the course to teach what the different algorithms are and what deep learning is. So here we will focus mostly on the deployment aspect of things only covering things about machine learning when they are important for more deployment.

If you feel you need to learn more about any of the things in this slide we have included plenty of additional resources that you can use to level up your skills. And of course you can always ask questions in the forums.

## Python programming

You should also have a good Python programming skills in particularly around libraries for numerical computing and machine learning. 

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn

We will capitalize on the use of the **`scikit-learn`  pipeline** so the more familiar you are with scikit-learn the most you will get out of the course. If you're not extremely familiar though, don't worry, we have included plenty of resources to brush up your skills. This might mean that you will need extra time to fully understand the code we present in this course. But by no means it means that you won't be able to get to the result desired which is deploying your mothers in this course.

>- In this course, we're going to use a **python 3.6** installation if you don't have one you can get it following the link in this slide. Any other Python three 3.6 installation will also do the trick. 
> - and we're going to tell more about **packaged versions** and **environments** in dedicated lectures.

Throughout the course we will be using datasets publicly available in Kaggle, so you will need to set up a Kaggle account which is totally free and will allow you to access to all the data sets and competitions available in Kaggle to try your newly acquired skills.

### Environments, git

- Python environments
- Git for version control

Finally it is important for water deployment to work in dedicated environments and use Git to track code version. Therefore knowledge of these skills will be highly beneficial for you.

We do however include a section to refresh on the use of environments and the use of Git which can help you get started and follow through the course.

In that section we will also include plenty of resources where you can learn more about environments and the use of IT in general.

So let's go ahead and get started.
