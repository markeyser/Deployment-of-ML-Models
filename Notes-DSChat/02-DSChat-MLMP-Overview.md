# Machine Learning Model Pipeline overview - Research Environment

- Here use last section summarizing model deployment. Also create the plot showing the pipeline. [09]
- We only need a skeleton (one slide) summarizing [10, 11, 12]
- The focus is on [14, 15, 16, 17 and 18]: Data analysis demo, Feature Engineering Demo, Feature Selection Demo and Model Building Demo and Getting Ready for Deployment Demo.
