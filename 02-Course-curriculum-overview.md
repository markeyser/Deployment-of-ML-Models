# Course curriculum overview

Welcome to the video on the course curriculum overview the course deployment of machine learning mothers contains 13 sections each one covering one key aspect of model deployment.

## Section 1: Introduction

- Course Curriculum Overview
- Knowledge requirements
- How to approach this course

The first section is an introduction section. It contains an introduction to the course and the instructors,  the course curriculum overview and the knowledge requirements that ideally you would have to make the most out of this course. 

It also contains some guidance on how to approach this course to maximize the knowledge that you can get from it.

## Section 2: Machine Learning - Research Environment

- Machine Learning pipeline overview
	- Data Gathering
	- Feature engineering
	- Feature selection
	- Machine Learning model building
	- Model assessment
- Both introduction and practical examples
- Starting point for deployment your machine learning models

In Section 2 we will recap on the different steps of a typical machine learning pipeline. We will give you an overview of data gathering, feature engineering, feature selection, building the machine learning models, and assessing the machine learning models.

We will cover the different steps both from a theory and a practical point of view. We will take you through a practical example of a typical machine learning pipeline to predict house sale price.

And this will create our starting machine learning model and code base to deploy the machine learning model.

Then we will cover the system architecture required to set up a research and deployment machine learning pipeline. You will learn what is a machine learning system architecture and why it is important. You will learn the different challenges encountered when creating a suitable system architecture. We will show you different architecture approaches and also the different architecture components.

Finally you will learn about the importance of building reproducible machine learning pipelines right from the start of any machine learning project.

## Section 4: Building a reproducible ML pipeline 

- How to transform your jupyter notebook into production ready code
	- Different ways utiised in the 

 in Section 4 you will learn how to write production code to deploy a machine learning model for data scientists.

This mean how to transform your Jupiter notebooks into production ready code go that is testable tractable and reproducible.

You will learn the different ways available unused in the industry.

You will learn how to code and deploy mothers using procedural programming or object oriented programming

creating a custom pipeline for your business and also how to write code utilizing object oriented programming
